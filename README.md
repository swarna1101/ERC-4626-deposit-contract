# ERC-4626-deposit-contract

Foundry (dapptools-style) property-based tests for [ERC4626] standard conformance.

[ERC4626]: <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626>

#### What is it?
- Test suites for checking if the given ERC4626 implementation satisfies the **standard requirements**.
- Dapptools-style **property-based tests** for fuzzing or symbolic execution testing.
- Tests that are **independent** from implementation details, thus applicable for any ERC4626 vaults.

#### Testing properties:

- **Round-trip properties**: no one can make a free profit by depositing and immediately withdrawing back and forth.

- **Functional correctness**: the `deposit()`, `mint()`, `withdraw()`, and `redeem()` functions update the balance and allowance properly.
- The `preview{Deposit,Redeem}()` functions **MUST NOT over-estimate** the exact amount.[^1]

[^1]: That is, the `deposit()` and `redeem()` functions “MUST return the same or more amounts as their preview function if called in the same transaction.”

- The `preview{Mint,Withdraw}()` functions **MUST NOT under-estimate** the exact amount.[^2]

[^2]: That is, the `mint()` and `withdraw()` functions “MUST return the same or fewer amounts as their preview function if called in the same transaction.”

- The `convertTo{Shares,Assets}` functions “**MUST NOT show any variations** depending on the caller.”

- The `asset()`, `totalAssets()`, and `max{Deposit,Mint,Withdraw,Redeem}()` functions “**MUST NOT revert**.”

## Usage

**Step 0**: Install [foundry] and add [forge-std] in your vault repo:
```bash
$ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash

$ cd /path/to/your-erc4626-vault
$ forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
```

[foundry]: <https://getfoundry.sh/>
[forge-std]: <https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std>

**Step 1**: Add this [erc4626-tests] as a dependency to your vault:
```bash
$ cd /path/to/your-erc4626-vault
$ forge install a16z/erc4626-tests
```

[erc4626-tests]: https://github.com/swarna1101/ERC-4626-deposit-contract

**Step 2**: Extend the abstract test contract [`ERC4626Test`](ERC4626.test.sol) with your own custom vault setup method, for example:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;

import ".\ERC4626.sol";

import { ERC20Mock   } from "/path/to/mocks/ERC20Mock.sol";
import { ERC4626Mock } from "/path/to/mocks/ERC4626Mock.sol";

contract ERC4626StdTest is ERC4626Test {
    function setUp() public override {
        _underlying_ = address(new ERC20Mock("Mock ERC20", "MERC20", 18));
        _vault_ = address(new ERC4626Mock(ERC20Mock(__underlying__), "Mock ERC4626", "MERC4626"));
        _delta_ = 0;
        _vaultMayBeEmpty = false;
        _unlimitedAmount = false;
    }
}
```

**Step 3**: Run `forge test`

```
$ forge test
```
